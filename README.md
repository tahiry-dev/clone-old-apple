## Built With

- HTML
- CSS

## Live Demo

Please take a look at the project on live [here](https://raw.githack.com/tahiry-dev/clone-old-apple/old-apple/index.html).

## Getting Started

1. I have used toggle pesticide to help me divide all the websites into small boxes.

2. From those boxes, I created the HTML structure.

3. I started to style the webpage from the header, the navigation bar is controlled by flexbox.

4. The main content was aligned with css grid.

5. The footer section is divided by float.

All the alignment techniques were present within this project according to the requirements.
